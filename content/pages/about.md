**Debi Dahan** is a Art Designer. my career in Art Design started 16 years ago. I studied at Lomda Design Graphic Course. I studied design theory and worked at Shichpulit in Elad where I worked with clients and prepared the print materials.

Later, I moved to Tiberias, where I founded the news paper for the orthodox community in a weekly publication. I'm responsible for all design work, from preparing ads and content to typesetting.

My studio, which I called 'studio dvd', was used by a private customer. I have worked on the child's book, ads, brochure, logo, branding, and printed materials.

Among my clients are Berman Halpert (Tarya"g), Devora Benedict, Benedict Nadlin, Shilat Daniel, etc.
