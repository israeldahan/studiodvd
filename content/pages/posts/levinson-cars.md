excerpt: >-
  Apparently, Japan is covered in magical and irresistibly cute animal
  sanctuaries. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of
  Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple
  buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the
  distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.
